# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
We will be creating the book database with Pandas. We will read in the data in a form of a csv and then Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Once the data is in usale form for the rest of the project, we will be using Python. 

## Database Storage
SQLlite is the database we intend to use, and we will be using an interactive python notebook to display our data. 

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is as follows. We start by fitting our data to be oversampled. We do this to try and counteract the massive parity in the number of cases that have a differnet outcome (we started with much more 1s than 0s). After the data has been resampled, we apply the Linear Regression model to try and create an accurate model. As the project progesses, we will tweak the model and try different results to get the best outcome. 

## Dashboard
We have discussed the best way to present our data. We have talked about using Tableau to display our results. We also plan on displaying different graphs of our data that will best fit the story that we end up telling about all of our book data.
