## Summary:

## Team Logistics

The majority of the our communication is comming from our teams shared slack channel. This is the place that we discuss developments to the project in mostly real time. We also utilize the time in class that we have been given to work on this project. In addition to all of these real time options, we all have exchanged phone numbers and email adresses to be able to get in contact with each other in a more urgent manner. Our communication has been a huge part of our project so far, as we were able to all agree on an idea and get to this point in the project.
